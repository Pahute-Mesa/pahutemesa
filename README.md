Version 0.0.1 (Alpha Build 3)

At Pahute Mesa we are a Disclosure Network and Research Center just trying to figure out the truth about NHI (Non-Human Intelligence), UAP (Unidentified Aerial Phenomena), TUO (Technology of Unknown Origin), and other mysteries. Matters are usually theoretical, but backed by about 18 years of research and studies. The pursuit has yet to be determined about some clues into the subject matter, but despite some occasional recursive false positive feedback loops, there's perseverance through the theoretical mischief managed.
